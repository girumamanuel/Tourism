	Addis Ababa, also spelled Addis Abeba, capital and largest city of Ethiopia.</p> 

<p>It is located on a well-watered plateau surrounded by hills and mountains in the geographic centre of the country.</p>

<p>Only since the late 19th century has Addis Ababa been the capital of the Ethiopian state.</p> 

<p>Its immediate predecessor, Entoto, was situated on a high tableland and was found to be unsatisfactory because of extreme cold and an acute shortage of firewood.</p> 

<p>The empress Taitu, wife of Emperor Menilek II (reigned 1889–1913), persuaded the emperor to build a house near the hot springs at the foot of the tableland and to grant land in the area to members of the nobility.</p>

<p>The city was thus founded in 1887 and was named Addis Ababa (“New Flower”) by the empress.</p>
