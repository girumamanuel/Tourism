<p>initiated by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed a few years ago, the building of Abrhot Library has cost the country 1.1 billion Birr.</p>

<p>It is built on 19,000 square meters of land near the national palace. With 1.5 kilometers shelf length, Abrhot can contain 1.4 million books, 250,000 soft copy books, and 300,000 research papers.</p>

<p>The compound has parking space for 115 vehicles, a meeting hall, amphitheater, shops, café and reading and playing areas for kids.</p>

<p>Indicating that in Africa Ethiopia is the only country having its own alphabet letters and only 18 countries in the world have their own alphabets,.</p>

<p> Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed stressed the need for the country to transfer its rich history and civilization to the next generation using such libraries.</p>

<p>The alphabets of the 18 countries is engraved on the wall of Abrhot library.</p>

<p>Abrihot means enlightenment in Amharic language.</p>

<p>Abiy also stressed that the reason why the country often entertains self-inflicted conflicts is because of lack of knowledge and ignorance.</p>

 <p>“Our major problem is ignorance,” he said, stressing the need for laying the foundation for Enlightened society in Ethiopia.</p>
