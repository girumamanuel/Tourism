	<p class="Entoto-text">Entoto Natural Park is a park of serenity and resounding joy.
	
Itâ€™s a unique place to discover the most breathtaking ancient mountain nature with streams flowing from clear springs and waterfalls.

The Park lies on the south-eastern slopes of Mt Entoto, between the northern limit of the city of Addis Ababa at an altitude of 2,600 m and the track along the mountain ridge at altitude over 3,100 m.

As Fascinating and captivating as Entoto Natural Park is, it lacked the necessary infrastructures and stayed underdeveloped for long.

To establish these necessary infrastructures and to make it a world-class visitor experience Prime Minster Abiy Ahmed initiated The Entoto Project alongside The Sheger River side projects.

Built with great imagination and ingenuity ,the planning and construction of the park was undergone by only Ethiopians in terms of Knowledge and finance.

Now Entoto Park is fully equipped with various indoor and outdoor facilities including sport centers, library, Entertainment, Restaurants and coffee shops, Artificial Lake and Fountains Walk ways, Bike, scooter and cart roots.

Most of These facilities were constructed using local material so they blend in beautifully with the natural environment of the park.

Entoto Natural Park will be significant in terms of facilitating service economies and changing the look and feel of the city of Addis Ababa.</p>
